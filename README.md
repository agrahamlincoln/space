# space
Basic space game in python.

This was a project I did for a simple video game development course. We used the pygame libraries to create a dynamic game.

The user will control a spaceship with the arrow keys and attempt to absorb a star on the map.
If the user collides with an entity, the game is lost.

Enemies and stars are randomly generated on the map, and enemies will grow over time to make the game increasingly hard.

The movement is asteroids-style with the arrow keys accelerating and decelerating movement in each direction.
